We should create a network of places in the “Dispatch”. Places mentioned in an article should be visualised with all their connections to other places in the same article. Therefore a python script generated a TSV file including the places, articleIDs, their connections (as weight), temporal information and the coordinates of the places. This TSV was imported to Gephi and used to create nodes and edges. Finally the visualisation was projected on a real geographical map via Gephi plug-ins, and it was exported as kmz and used as a layer for visualisation in Google Earth.

In a first try I used all data for the year 1864. In a second try I used 1864, but visualised only those 
relationships of places, with a frequency of 10 or higher, leading to a much clearer visualisation. What is displayed here, shows the relationship of places mentioned together for 10 or more times in the year 1864.
